# webgl-plot
multi-line high-performance 2D graphs using native WebGL. The advantages are:

 * Simple and efficient 2D WebGL interface
 * Using WebGL native line drawing 
 * High update rate which matches the screen refresh rate
 * Full control over the color of each line in each frame
 * No dependencies
 * Works on any browser/platform that [supports WebGL](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl)
 * Ideal for embedded systems with low resources
 

## What are the use cases?
When plotting real-time multiple waveforms are required. For example, software-based oscilloscopes, Arduino, microcontrollers, FPGA user interfaces. This framework also can be used in combination with ElectronJS.

## Limitations
cannot change the line width due to the OpenGL implementation of a line. The OpenGL specification only guarantees a minimum of a single pixel line width. There are other solutions to increase the line width however they substantially increase the size of data vector and take a hit on the performance.

## Why TypeScript?
Because it is much more convenient to maintain and scale up. If you are not familiar with TS, then just use the examples as your template.

## Getting started
See examples at [webgl-plot-examples](https://github.com/danchitnis/webgl-plot-examples)

## API Documentation
See [here ðŸ“‘](https://danchitnis.github.io/webgl-plot/)

## How to use with embedded systems applications?
You can use WebUSB, Web Bluetooth, and Serial API. Examples will be provided soon.
